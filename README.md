Project Title: EDA and Machine Learning Prediction on Bangalore Rent Post-COVID using Python

Overview

This project delves into the intricacies of Bangalore's post-COVID rental market, employing a robust blend of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning techniques. The primary objective is to construct accurate predictive models for rent prices in Bangalore, leveraging a comprehensive dataset.

Key Objectives

1. Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Conduct in-depth analysis to uncover underlying patterns and trends within the dataset
- Utilize visualization techniques (Seaborn, Pandas) to present insights effectively

2. Machine Learning Model Development:
- Implement and evaluate various regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Lasso Regression)
- Assess model accuracy and robustness using relevant metrics
  
3. Methodology

a. Data Acquisition and Cleaning:
- Gather a comprehensive dataset containing relevant features like location, size, amenities, etc
- Cleanse the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
b. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Employ statistical analysis and visualization techniques to:
Identify correlations between features
Understand the distribution of numerical variables
Analyze categorical variables and their impact on rent prices
c. Model Building and Evaluation:
- Train and evaluate multiple regression models:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Lasso Regression

Comparing model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared
